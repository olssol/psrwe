\arguments{
\item{dta_psbor}{A class \code{PSRWE_BOR} object generated by
\code{\link{psrwe_borrow}}.}

\item{v_outcome}{Column name corresponding to the outcome.}

\item{outcome_type}{Type of outcomes: \code{continuous} or \code{binary}.}

\item{stderr_method}{Method for computing StdErr, see Details}

\item{...}{Parameters for \code{rwe_cl}}
}
\value{
A data frame with class name \code{PSRWE_RST}. It contains the
    composite estimation of the mean for each stratum as well as the
    jackknife estimation for each subject. The results can be further
    summarized by its S3 method \code{summary}.
    The results can be also analyzed by \code{psrwe_outana} for outcome
    analysis and inference.
}
\description{
Estimate the mean of the outcome based on PS-integrated composite likelihood
approach. Variance is estimated by Jack-Knife method. Applies to the case
when there is only one external data source.
}
\details{
\code{stderr_method} include \code{jk} as default
    using Jackknife method within each stratum,
    \code{sjk} for simple Jackknife method for combined estimates
    such as point estimates in single arm or treatment effects in RCT, or
    \code{cjk} for complex Jackknife method including refitting PS model,
    matching, trimming, calculating borrowing parameters, and
    combining overall estimates.
    Note that \code{sjk} may take a while longer to finish and
    \code{cjk} will take even much longer to finish.
